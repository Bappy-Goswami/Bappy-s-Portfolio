<p>Guess what? Another glorious year has passed, and I have officially leveled up! 🥳</p>

<p><h4>You're invited to witness the chaos as I attempt to blow out an alarming number of candles, 
    <br />Eat more cake than socially acceptable, and maybe—just maybe—accept that I’m getting older.</h4></p>

<p><h4>🎶 Dress Code:</h4> Anything that lets you bust a move without pulling a muscle</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Expect food,</li>
        <li>fun,</li>
        <li>and questionable dance moves.</li>
    </ol>   
    <h4>There will be games, laughter, and the annual tradition of pretending we’re still 21. 😎</h4></p>

<ul>
    <li>Come for the party.</li>
    <li>Stay for the memories.</li>
    <li>And if you bring a gift, you automatically get cake (totally fair deal)</li>

</ul>

<p><h4>RSVP by 10th October,</h4> or just show up and surprise me!</p>

<h3>See you there! 🎂🎈</h3>
